# ansible-projects
Small admin projects for hubs-cloud

First-Project
Created a playbook to print hubs service running on existing clinet 

One would need to create a inventory file for EC2 
Ex [here](https://mytechretreat.com/ansible-ssh-into-an-aws-ec2-instance/)

This will cut time ssh into your instances to check for bio status.
